# Constants

Constants are variables whose value does not change. When constants are defined, assignment must be made. Once the assignment is made, it cannot be assigned again and its value cannot be changed.

```
// Constant define
const PI = 3.14
```

```
// Constant define by type
const:float E = 2.71
```
